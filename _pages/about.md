I’m a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University of Technology in 2012 and my M.E. from USTC in 2015. I worked as a Senior Algorithm Engineer at Baidu (2015–2020) and at Meituan (2020–2024) , where I focused on advertising algorithms. My research interests include large language models (LLMs), device–edge–cloud collaboration, and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xinming Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xinming/).
