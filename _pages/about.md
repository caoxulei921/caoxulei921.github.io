I’m a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2012 and the M.E. degree in computer science and technology from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2015. My research interests include large language models (LLMs), device–edge–cloud collaboration, and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xinming Zhang](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
